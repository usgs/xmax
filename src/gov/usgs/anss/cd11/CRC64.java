/**
 * This classs was derived from a C module CRC64.c given to us by James
 * BlinkHorn of the Canadian data center. Below are comments from the original
 * source:
 * 
 * Defined to be the 64 bit Cyclic Redundancy Check with the polynomial x64 + x4
 * + x3 + x1 + x0. The high order bit is implicitly 1, so this is specified by
 * the value 11011 in binary or 0x1b. To speed computation, we pre-compute a "T"
 * vector. T[i] is the remainder of dividing i*x64 by the polynomial.n For more
 * information on CRC see D.V. Sarwate, "Computation of cyclic redundancy via
 * table look-up," Comm. ACM 31(8), Aug. 1988, p. 1008-1013.
