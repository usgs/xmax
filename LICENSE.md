License
========

This software was written originally by Instrumental Software Technologies, Inc. (ISTI).
ISTI was contracted to create a Java language port of the fortran program called XYZ.
It included GPL v2.0 code and thus was licensed as GPL v2.0.

However, the software has dependencies on GPL v3.0 code and Apache v2.0 which are both
incompatible with GPL v2.0.  
This licensing conflict prevents distributing this software bundled with all dependencies.
As it currently exists this project is a collection of source files with differing licenses determined by authorship.  
Development is currently working toward migrating code to be entirely GPL v3.0 compatible.  

As a whole this source code (not compiled project) is licensed under GPL v2.0 with individual pieces under other licenses.
